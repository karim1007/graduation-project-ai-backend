    "Implement a custom PyTorch module called `ScaledDotProductAttention` that computes the scaled dot-product attention mechanism used in Transformer models. Your implementation should take three inputs: queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V), each as tensors of shape `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)`. The module should compute attention scores, apply a softmax to obtain attention weights, and return the weighted sum of the values.

This means that Euclidean distances in CIELAB space correspond more closely to human color perception differences than in RGB space. Using k-means clustering in CIELAB space leads to clusters that better represent distinct colors as perceived by humans, which improves segmentation quality. In contrast, RGB distances can be misleading due to its non-uniformity, causing clusters to group colors that are perceptually different or separate colors that appear similar to humans.",
    "Python's asynchronous programming model, primarily facilitated by the asyncio library, allows programs to handle IO-bound and high-level structured network code concurrently without the complexity of threading or multiprocessing. At its core, asyncio is built around the concept of an event loop, which is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks, performs network IO operations, and manages subprocesses.\n\nCoroutines are special functions defined with `async def` that can pause their execution at `await` points, allowing the event loop to switch context to other coroutines. This cooperative multitasking enables efficient concurrency without the overhead of multiple threads. Tasks are wrappers around coroutines scheduled to run on the event loop; they track the execution state of coroutines. Futures represent a placeholder for a result that is initially unknown but will be available at some point, often used internally in asyncio to signal completion.\n\nA practical example involves fetching data concurrently from multiple URLs. Using the `aiohttp` library, which supports asynchronous HTTP requests, we can define an async function `fetch` that awaits an HTTP GET request and returns the response text. By creating multiple tasks, each fetching a different URL, and running them concurrently with `asyncio.gather`, we achieve efficient IO-bound concurrency.\n\nExample:\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def fetch(session, url):\n    async with session.get(url) as response:\n        return await response.text()\n\nasync def main(urls):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch(session, url)) for url in urls]\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        return results\n\nurls = [\n    'https://example.com',\n    'https://python.org',\n    'https://asyncio.org'\n]\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    data = asyncio.run(main(urls))\n    for content in data:\n        print(len(content))\n```\n\nBenefits of asyncio over traditional multithreading/multiprocessing include lower overhead (no need to spawn multiple threads or processes), avoidance of issues like race conditions and deadlocks inherent in threading, and better scalability for IO-bound tasks. However, asyncio has pitfalls: it is single-threaded, so CPU-bound tasks block the event loop and degrade performance; it requires libraries to support async-await natively; and developers must carefully design coroutine interactions to avoid subtle bugs.\n\nIn summary, asyncio provides a powerful paradigm for writing concurrent Python programs optimized for IO-bound operations, leveraging coroutines and event loops for efficient task management while avoiding many complexities of thread-based concurrency.",
    "False. Increasing the number of features without proper feature selection or dimensionality reduction can lead to overfitting, increased computational cost, and the curse of dimensionality. This often degrades model performance rather than improving it, especially if many features are irrelevant or noisy.",
    "Indexing in database systems is a critical technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. An index is a data structure that allows the database engine to find rows faster without scanning the entire table. Indexes work similarly to the index of a book, pointing to the location of desired data efficiently.\n\nTwo common types of indexes are B-tree indexes and bitmap indexes. \n\nB-tree indexes are balanced tree data structures that maintain sorted data and allow searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Each node in a B-tree contains keys and pointers to child nodes, organizing data hierarchically. B-tree indexes are suitable for high-cardinality columns (columns with many unique values), such as primary keys or unique identifiers. They perform well with range queries and equality searches. Their advantages include efficient handling of dynamic data that frequently changes and relatively low overhead for insertions and deletions. However, B-tree indexes can become large in size, particularly with very large tables, and may require more maintenance during heavy write operations.\n\nBitmap indexes, on the other hand, use bit arrays (bitmaps) and are especially efficient for columns with low cardinality (few distinct values) such as gender, status flags, or categorical attributes. Each distinct value in the column has an associated bitmap, where each bit represents a row in the table; a bit set to 1 indicates the presence of the value in that row. Bitmap indexes allow very fast bitwise operations (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions, making them ideal for complex ad hoc queries common in data warehousing and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). Their advantages include compact storage for low-cardinality data and efficient multi-dimensional queries. Limitations include poor performance in environments with frequent updates or inserts because modifying bitmaps can be costly, and they are not suitable for high-cardinality columns.\n\nThe choice of indexing strategy impacts query performance and storage overhead significantly. B-tree indexes offer balanced performance for transactional systems where write operations are frequent, and queries often involve range scans or unique lookups. Bitmap indexes optimize read-heavy environments with complex query predicates over categorical data, such as large-scale data warehouses. However, bitmap indexes can consume less space when cardinality is low but may grow prohibitively large if cardinality increases.\n\nIn summary, effective indexing requires understanding both the data characteristics and query patterns. Using B-tree indexes on columns with high cardinality and frequent writes ensures balanced performance, while bitmap indexes excel in read-intensive, low-cardinality environments where complex query filtering is common. Poor indexing choices can lead to slow queries, increased I/O, and excessive storage use, highlighting the importance of tailored indexing strategies in large-scale databases.",
    "Database normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables. The process aims to ensure data consistency and integrity while improving query efficiency. The most commonly used normal forms are the first three: 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.\n\n1. First Normal Form (1NF): A table is in 1NF if all its attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique. This means no repeating groups or arrays are allowed. For example, a table storing customer orders should not list multiple products in a single field; instead, each product should be in a separate row.\n\n2. Second Normal Form (2NF): A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just part of it. This primarily applies to tables with composite primary keys. For example, if a table contains (OrderID, ProductID) as a composite key, attributes like ProductName should depend on ProductID alone, not the whole key. To achieve 2NF, such attributes are moved to separate tables.\n\n3. Third Normal Form (3NF): A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no non-key attribute depends transitively on the primary key. That is, non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes. For example, if a table contains EmployeeID, DepartmentID, and DepartmentName, DepartmentName depends on DepartmentID, not directly on EmployeeID. To reach 3NF, DepartmentName would be moved to a separate Department table.\n\nNormalization reduces data redundancy by ensuring that each piece of information is stored only once. This minimizes anomalies during insertions, updates, and deletions, thus improving data integrity. It also makes maintenance easier and reduces storage requirements.\n\nHowever, highly normalized databases can have drawbacks. They often require more complex joins across multiple tables, which can impact query performance, especially in read-heavy applications. Excessive normalization can also increase the complexity of database design and make it harder for developers unfamiliar with the schema to write efficient queries. In some scenarios, denormalization is intentionally used to optimize performance or simplify reporting, balancing redundancy with speed.\n\nIn summary, normalization up to 3NF is a foundational technique in relational database design that improves data organization and integrity but needs to be balanced against performance considerations depending on the application context.",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer vision by providing powerful models capable of automatically learning hierarchical feature representations from raw image data. Unlike traditional fully connected neural networks, which treat input data as a flat vector and ignore spatial relationships, CNNs preserve the spatial structure of images by using local connections and parameter sharing. This makes CNNs particularly well-suited for image processing tasks.\n\nCNNs differ from fully connected networks primarily in their architecture. Instead of connecting every input neuron to every output neuron, CNNs use convolutional layers where filters (kernels) slide over the input data to detect local patterns such as edges, textures, or more complex features. This local connectivity reduces the number of parameters, improving computational efficiency and reducing overfitting.\n\nKey components of a CNN include:\n\n1. **Convolutional Layers:** These layers apply multiple filters to the input, generating feature maps that highlight the presence of specific patterns. Each filter is trained to recognize a distinct feature, and because the same filter is applied across the entire image, CNNs exploit spatial invariance.\n\n2. **Pooling Layers:** Pooling (such as max pooling or average pooling) reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps, making the representations more compact and invariant to small translations or distortions in the input. This downsampling helps reduce computational load and controls overfitting.\n\n3. **Fully Connected Layers:** After several convolutional and pooling layers, the network typically includes one or more fully connected layers. These layers integrate the extracted features to perform high-level reasoning, such as classification or regression. By connecting all neurons, they combine the spatially extracted features into final output predictions.\n\nIn summary, CNNs are critical in computer vision because they effectively capture spatial hierarchies in images through convolution and pooling, enabling robust feature extraction and accurate classification. Their specialized architecture addresses the challenges of image data that traditional fully connected networks cannot efficiently handle.",
    "False. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor is primarily used to capture gradient orientation and edge information in images, which helps in detecting object shapes and structures. It does not capture color information; instead, it focuses on the distribution of intensity gradients or edge directions, which makes it effective for tasks like pedestrian detection where shape and contour are more important than color.",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique designed to prevent overfitting by randomly 'dropping out' (setting to zero) a subset of neurons during each training iteration. This forces the network to not rely too heavily on any particular neurons, promoting redundancy and robustness in learned representations. During inference, all neurons are used but their outputs are typically scaled to account for the dropout during training. This technique helps improve generalization performance on unseen data.",
